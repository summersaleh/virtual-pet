# week 2 project virtual-pet




Created a scanner that would search for user input.


Created a new object called "bear" for the VirtualPet class.

Opening statement for the game.


User then chosses a name for the object.

I created a method so that the user can choose to quit at any moment by inputing "quit".
User can type "needs" at any point to see its pet's stats using an if statement.

Created a do/while loop

Created if statements with methods where if the bears stats get below or above a certain point the bear will say what it needs.
If all the stats get too high the bear will die and the game will end.

Created if statments so that the bears stats will never get below zero.

Created a menu so the user knows its options to play with it's pet.

The tick advances the game a day and adds to the bears needs.
